                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Deer hunter 2018 is a mobile game under shooting genre which provides hunting experience to users. The game was released
                    on 2016 and part of the evergreen Deer hunter franchise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my initial days at Glu mobile, I started looking at the data to identify opportunities to improvise the user
                    experience of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    **This case is heavily based on research and the data i used for analysis are internal property of Glu Mobile, which i can't share, hence i won't be revealing the numbers at all.

                <h2>Identifying the oppurtunities</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During my initial days at Glu mobile, I started looking at the data to identify opportunities to improvise the user
                    experience of the game as i believe that everything related to the product from app install to customer service is a
                    part of user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I was monitoring the data using tableau, I came to notice a significant churn rate (churn rate basically means the
                    rate of user drop) as they gets into each step of the game, which triggered me to push for a on boarding optimization to
                    the pipeline.
                </p>
                
                <hr></hr>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                
                <p>As I pitched this to my manager and the product team, they welcomed it and before i know it, it got into the pipeline.
                Now, I need to define the problem statement : "There is a significant churn at the early stages of the game and our goal
                is to reduce it"</p>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <hr></hr>
                <h2>Modus Operandi</h2>
                
                <p>
                    As the game is huge with a heavy loyal user base, we have to approach the problem quite strategically, eliminating all
                    the possibilities for any radical change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a start, I decided that, at first I will be analyzing the stage till the first trophyhunt (Trophy hunt is terminology
                    for boss fight in Deer Hunter 2018) and for the second stage, we will analyze the way our multiple modes are surfaced to
                    the users.
                </p>
                
                <hr></hr>
                <h2>Collection and analysis of data</h2>
                
                <p>
                    As i mentioned earlier, This was a data heavy process which required lots of data analysis, which was done with the help
                    of tableau, excel and few numpy functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also relied heavily on qualitative data analysis as well, we used surveys and playtesting as a means of collecting
                    qualitative data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we gathered the data, I started connecting the dots. The process includes identifying the drop percentage between
                    two points, and then breaking it into multiple stages and then finally identifying a place where significant drop is
                    happening. Once we identify that point, we then move on to the qualitative data that we have to understand why this is
                    happening.
                </p>
                <hr></hr>
                <h2>
                    Design
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From the data analysis, we recognized the areas which are causing user churn and then moved ahead to solve them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    Proposition
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We proposed that by identifying the painpoints and optimizing the flow while avoiding a radical change in the existing
                    user flow within the game can bring a significant improvement in the user retention.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    Concept
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the pain points which users didnt like</li>
                    <li>Let the users choose without leading them to confusion</li>
                    <li>Test multiple variants to optimize the onboarding further</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Structure</h3>
                <p>Previously, within the game lots of users identified forcing as a definite pain point, they didnt like the idea of game
                taking them to something different while they were trying something else, we went to fix that part.</p>
                <p>
                    We decided that users should feel the unlocking of other modes as their choice by unlocking them contextually.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Information that we needed to evaluation</h3>
                <p>
                    Once we are ready with the design, we have to define success metrics, also we have to see which model works. For this,
                    we decided to send this as a A/B experiment with one control variant and one test variant.
                </p>
                <hr></hr>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Once the experiment is sent, and we got results, we realized that the optimization has improved the user retention
                    largely during the early stages.
