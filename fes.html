                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                Deer hunter 2018 is a mobile game under shooting genre which provides hunting experience to users. The game was released
                on 2016 and part of the evergreen Deer hunter franchise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my stint at Glu, we built a weekly tournament event which is aimed to engage users intensely over a period of
                    time.
                </p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    As the game is getting older, we need a periodicl tournament system to engage players within a particular interval. We
                    also have to make sure that, its not heavy on our resources as well.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>
                    How did we approach the problem
                </h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once the problem is defined by the stakeholders, it is now time to see how are we going to approach the problem. For
                    this, I've been paired up with the Game design lead.
                </p>
                <p>We decided to split the problem into two:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Creating a tournament system within the game</li>
                    <li>Create a platform for game designers, developers and UI artists in such a way that, they dont have to do lots of work on
                    each tournament.</li>
                    </ol>


                    <hr></hr>
            
                <h2>Collecting Data & Research</h2>
              
                <p>
                    As we planned out the approach, now we have to decide how are we going to surface this. But before that, I had to invest
                    in user researching as I joined the company a month ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To understand our users, I started referring user research reports from 2016 onwards, fortunately our company had lots
                    of research reports for the genre as Deer hunter is an evergreen franchise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with the qualitative reports I got from the research team, I started monitoring the quantitative data using
                    tableau to understand user interaction with different game modes.
                    (As of now, Deer hunter have 4 modes.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on our researches, we decided to create a tournament which goes hand in hand with the game progression while
                    eliminating the Pay to win scenario. Pay to win scenario arises when the user who spends more money with in game have an upper hand all the time apart from
                    experience.
                </p>

                    Competitor Analysis
                </h2>
                        <p>We started analyzing other games and their tournament systems to understand how are they running it. During this
                        process, the questions we asked ourselves was:
                    </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How are they integrating the tournament to their progression system?</li>
                    <li>How often are they triggering the notifications</li>
                    <li>How are they distributing rewards</li>
                    <li>How are they giving an exclusive look to the event.</li>
                    <li>How are they introducing the event</li>
                    <li>Hows the usability</li>
                    <li>What are the user goals and product goals.</li>
                    <li>How can we set up an event</li>
                    <li>what are the trivial information for setting up an event and how can we reduce user's efforts while setting it up.
                    </li>
                    <li>How can we automate, the same process in the future.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I started looking at lots of games which have any events inside them. These are the few games i loved the most among 14+
                    competitor products.Â

                <p>
                    At this part, myself and the Game design lead started creating the architecture for the system.</p>
                <p>    
                    Based on our researches and studies, we decided that the event should based on the gunning mode and the users will get
                    assessed and rewarded based on their progress in the core loop.
                </p>

                <h3>Proposition</h3>
                <p>We will be building a tournament event that would appear on every weekend along with an internal tool that helps
                designers and developers too setup the event with relatively minimal effort than before.</p>
                <br>

                    <li>Event will be based on gunning mode</li>
                    <li>Will trigger within a defined period, for eg: every weekends.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the event, users will be rewarded</li>
                    <li>The event will be announced exclusively</li>
                    <li>Winnings will be celebrated</li>
                    <li>There won't be any pay to win scenario</li>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once the event went out, we noticed that the user engagement on event days are comparitively intense than other days. As
                    this event is tied to the normal progression, user progression rates rose with monetary benefits. We also noticed a
                    spike in elder player's (user's who've been playing the game for a longer time) engagement.
                </p>
